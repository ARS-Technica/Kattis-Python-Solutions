"""
Every year, Pumpkin Pete comes up with a couple of different Jack-O’-Lantern 
ideas for his annual Halloween special. He stacks them up on haystacks for 
everyone to enjoy and take pictures with. To make sure that there’s a wide 
variety of displays, he wants to make sure many possible Jack-O’-Lanterns 
designs are available. He has come up with many eye, nose, and mouth designs 
and would like to know how many unique designs are possible. He needs your 
help to set up the displays before the special kicks off!

Input
The input consists of one line which contains three integers. The first, N, 
indicates the number of eye designs. The second, T, indicates the number of 
nose designs. The third, M, indicates the number of mouth designs. All three 
values are in the range [1,500].
